🧠 Project Concepts – Theoretical Overview
⚛️ React (Frontend Library)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces using components. Each component represents a part of the UI (like a button, a form, or a profile card) and can manage its own data and behavior. React updates the page dynamically without reloading, offering a smooth user experience.

⚡ Vite (Build Tool)

Vite is a modern build tool that helps you start and develop projects quickly. It’s faster than older tools like Create React App because it serves your code directly using native browser modules and only rebuilds what's necessary during development.

🌐 React Router DOM (Routing)

React Router enables navigation between different views or pages in a single-page application (SPA). Instead of reloading the entire page, React Router updates only the parts that change. For example, clicking on a user's profile link navigates to /user/:username and shows new content without a full page refresh.

🎨 Tailwind CSS (Styling)

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing custom CSS, you apply pre-defined class names directly to your HTML or JSX elements. These classes control layout, spacing, colors, fonts, and more — allowing for fast and consistent styling.

📡 GitHub API (Data Source)

The GitHub API allows your application to fetch real-time data about GitHub users. When a user searches for a GitHub username, your app makes a request to GitHub’s public API to retrieve profile details like name, avatar, followers, bio, and blog links.

🌍 Dynamic Routing with URL Parameters

Dynamic routing allows pages to be generated based on the URL. For example, if your route is /user/:username, the :username part is dynamic. Your app reads that value from the URL, fetches the corresponding user data from the GitHub API, and displays it — all without reloading the page.

💡 Single Page Application (SPA)

Your app is a Single Page Application, meaning it loads once, and all content changes happen through JavaScript. This makes the app feel faster and more interactive, since only parts of the page are updated rather than the whole page reloading.

🧩 Component-Based Architecture

Your app is broken down into small, reusable components (like a header, search bar, or user profile card). Each component is self-contained and can be reused across different parts of the app, improving maintainability and scalability.

🌐 Deployment & Hosting

Once built, your project can be deployed on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. These services host your app and make it accessible via a public link so others can use it.

✅ Summary of How It All Works Together:

React builds the UI using components.

Vite runs the development server and builds your app for production.

React Router handles page navigation without reloads.

Tailwind CSS styles the UI with utility classes.

GitHub API provides real-time user data.

Dynamic URLs allow users to access different profiles using /user/:username.
